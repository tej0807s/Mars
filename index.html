        <p>
            Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than
            only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red
            Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a
            reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.Mars is a terrestrial
            planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the
            valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

            Mars Orbiter Mission is India's first interplanetary mission to planet Mars with an orbiter craft designed
            to orbit Mars in an elliptical orbit. The Mission is primarily technological mission considering the
            critical mission operations and stringent requirements on propulsion and other bus systems of spacecraft. It
            has been configured to carry out observation of physical features of mars and carry out limited study of
            Martian atmosphere.

            The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan ("Mars-craft", from mangala, "Mars" and yƒÅna, "craft,
            vehicle"), is a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the
            Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).It is India's first interplanetary mission and it made it the
            fourth space agency to achieve Mars orbit, after Roscosmos, NASA, and the European Space Agency.It made
            India the first Asian nation to reach Martian orbit and the first nation in the world to do so on its maiden
            attempt.
